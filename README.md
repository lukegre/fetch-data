Download remote data (HTTP, FTP, SFTP) and store locally for data pipeline.

This package was created out of the frustration that it is very difficult to download data easily with `intake`.
`fetch-data` is a mash-up of `fsspec` and `pooch` making it easy to download multiple files and store all the info, making it good for data pipeline applications.


Installation
------------
Currently, this package is
`pip install git+https://github.com/lukegre/fetch-data.git`


Basic usage
-----------

Use the download function directly:

```python
flist = fd.download(url)
```

The file will be downloaded to the current directory and will be populated with a readme file, cached file list, and logging information.


Using with YAML catalogs
------------------------
Use the catalog YAML entry
```python
import fetch_data as fd
cat = fd.read_catalog(cat_fname)
flist = fd.download(**cat['entry_name'])
```

The catalog should be structured as shown below:
```yaml
entry_name:
    url: remote path to file/s. Can contain *
    dest: where the file/s will be stored - can have optional {} placeholders that will be replaced
    meta:  # this will be written to the README file
        doi: url to the data source
        description: info about the data
        citation: how to cite this dataset
    placeholder: value  # optional will replace values in dest
```
