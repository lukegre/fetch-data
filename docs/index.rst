Welcome to fetch-data
=====================

Fetch data is a simple tool to quickly download data from various sources.
It is a package I've developed for my own needs, so I haven't written too
many tests. The :code:`fetch-data` relies on two established packages,
:code:`pooch` and :code:`fsspec`. I have combined these to make the
downloading process quick and easy.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install fetch-data
