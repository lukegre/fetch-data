era5_data:
  # ERA5 data uses the CDS API to download data. The inputs are thus different
  # from the other data entries. The destination must be the full path name
  # (year, month and day are available as vars).
  # Install the cdsapi package and then set up the config file in at ~/.cdsapirc
  dest: /path_to_dataset_on_local_server/{year}/ERA5_{year}_{month}.nc
  # cds_var_names gives the names as listed on the Climate Data Store and is only
  # used for downloading the data. `variables` is used for processing
  cds_var_names:
    - 10m_u_component_of_wind
    - 10m_v_component_of_wind
    - mean_sea_level_pressure
  is_era5: true
  variables:
    u10: u10_era5
    v10: v10_era5
  meta:
    # note that this metadata will be true for all ERA5 data downloaded using this tool
